"""Unit tests for the cost-model reporting pass (``cost_model_pass.py``).

The properties guarded here are the ones the report's arithmetic depends on.

* **A kernel is priced once.** ``predict_ops`` is defined over a fused bundle and is
  not additive over its ops -- it de-duplicates external inputs shared inside the
  bundle. Pricing ops separately and summing gives a different number entirely.
  ``_feats`` therefore gives every op the SAME external input ``arg0``, which is what
  makes ``_fused_hbm_bytes`` de-duplicate: with distinct input names the de-dup branch
  never runs and a sum-of-parts implementation would pass every test here.
* **Grouping follows contiguity, not tiling.** ``spyre_fuse_nodes`` fuses every
  contiguous run of Spyre nodes into one bundle, so the report must too. An earlier
  version gave each untiled op its own group and under-predicted a 5-op softmax by 45 %.
* **The per-op column sums back to its kernel total**, because the report prints both.

No Spyre device or backend compiler is required -- ops are injected directly.
