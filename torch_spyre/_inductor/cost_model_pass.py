"""Predicted-runtime reporting over the pre-scheduling loop-level IR.

Runs immediately after ``CustomPreSchedulingPasses`` has finished, where the
loop-level IR is final: layouts resolved, restickify inserted, coarse-tiling applied,
work division committed, scratchpad placed. It partitions the graph into the kernels
the backend will build, prices each with the analytical model in ``cost_model.py``,
and returns a :class:`CostReport` carrying the program total plus a breakdown.

The report is a *value*, not just a printout, so another pass or an external tool can
compare two candidate plans without compiling and running either. That is the point:
``report_a.total_us`` vs ``report_b.total_us`` is a cheap plan comparison.

NOT related to ``work_division.cost_model_matmul_division``, which is a separate model
used to choose a matmul work division. This module is the analytical whole-program
runtime model documented in ``docs/source/compiler/cost_model.md``.

Disabled by default. When the flag is off this module does no work at all -- it returns
before touching the graph -- so leaving it off costs one attribute read per compilation.

HOW OPS ARE GROUPED, AND WHY IT MATTERS
---------------------------------------
``predict_ops`` is defined over ONE FUSED KERNEL and is deliberately not additive over
its ops: it de-duplicates external inputs shared inside a bundle and its turnaround and
overlap terms are ``min``/``max`` reductions over bundle totals. Pricing ops separately
and adding is therefore simply a different quantity -- measured across 521 recorded
multi-op bundles the difference ranges from -94 % to +33 %. It is zero on 32 % of them
(no shared external input, so the de-dup never fires) and, where it differs at all, an
UNDER-count about seven times in ten. So the grouping has to match what the backend
actually fuses.

``spyre_fuse_nodes`` (``fusion.py``) accumulates every *contiguous run* of Spyre nodes
into one bundle, with no size limit; only a non-Spyre node breaks the run. This module
mirrors that: contiguous modellable ops form one group. An earlier version made every
untiled op its own group, which under-predicted a 5-op softmax by 45 % because the real
kernel is one bundle, not five.

Coarse-tiling ``loop_group_id`` is still read, but for *labelling* the loop structure
inside a group -- not for deciding group boundaries.

      ``hbm_bytes / trip``. This holds for an operand that advances (factor 1, whole
      tensor spread over the loop) and one the loop holds fixed (factor = trip, whole
      tensor fetched every pass) alike, and for the nested case in between -- ``mm`` under
      ``mm_nested_m_k`` really does carry ``1 < factor < trip``, so a rule that branched on
